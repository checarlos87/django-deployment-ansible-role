# Important notes regarding this role:
#   1. This role assumes it will have access to
#      a Python installation that already has 
#      virtualenv installed. The path to the desired 
#      Python is set in the "python_path" variable.
#   2. SELinux is not handled at all in this role.
#      Set SELinux up however you see fit. Keep in mind
#      that a "enforcing" state with default configuration
#      will interfere with nginx's logs.
#   3. This role does not install a specific Django 
#      app. It simply handles deployment of Django
#      itself, eventually creating a new empty project
#      for an app to be plugged into.
#   4. The app_name variable can only accept letters, 
#      numbers, and unserscores and must begin with a 
#      letter. These requirements are not checked in the
#      role, but you will trip up the role if they are not
#      followed. Specifically, nginx's site-available
#      config will not be properly rendered, but Ansible
#      will not complain.
